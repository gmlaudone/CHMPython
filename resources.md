# Python installation.

The Python installation needed for this series of workshops has been deployed to the computer suites where these sessions are going to take place. You can also download it and install it on your own computer. It's free and it can be installed on Windows, MacOSX and Linux computers. The installation file and the instructions needed to install the Anaconda Python distribution to your computer can be found [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 

**IMPORTANT:** you should download the Python 2.7 version of Anaconda Python. Python 3.x has some small but significant differences, and some of the code we use in this module will only work in Python 2.x.

This Python distribution contains all the libraries and tools that we'll be using in the workshops.

# Books and other resources.

The content of this website gives a very basic introduction to some beginner's programming concepts and to the Python programming language. While the website contains all you need in order to complete the workshops and your [assignment](assessment), it does not cover all the facets of computer programming and it does not go into the details of the Python language. If you are interested in learning the language more thoroughly, you could start from some of the official documentation.

*   [Official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/) 
*   [NumPy and SciPy official documentation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
*   [Jupyter official documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)

There are also many free e-books available:

*   [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed Shaw.
*   [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) by Allen Downey.
*   [A Byte of Python](http://python.swaroopch.com/) by C. H. Swaroop.
*   [Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html) by the OpenTechSchool

If you have specific programming issues, I would recommend the search function on the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) website, where you are very likely to find the answer to most of your coding problems.

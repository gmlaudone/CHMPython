During each workshop you will be asked to create a new Jupyter notebook. You will use the notebook to carry out the tasks described in the workshop's script. These tasks have been designed with the aim to interactively  introduce you to the basics of computer programming, and they mainly involve copying snippets of code, carrying out small changes to the code and running the code in order to verify its output. You are asked to simply follow the instructions and produce tidy code that runs and outputs the expected results. This part of your coursework will be assigned a mark from 0 to 30 (5 x a maximum of 6 marks). 

In the **Applications** section of each workshop, you will be asked to use the coding concepts learnt during the interactive session in order to create simple programs and complete the short assignments. This part of your coursework will be assigned a mark from 0 to 50 (5 x a maximum of 10 marks).

At the end of the series of workshops you will also be presented with [one final (sightly more complex) coding task](final-assignment-2019). This will be assigned a mark from 0 to 20.

Your code will be evaluated according to these criteria:

* Does the code run? (*hint:* run your code and make sure it does not produce errors)
* Does the code fulfil the assignment? (*hint:* run your code and make sure it outputs the expected results)
* Is the code readable and understandable? (*hint:* use clear variable names and add comments to your code)
* Is the code efficient? (*hint*: once your code is working and producing the expected results, ensure that it is also efficient and optimise it, if necessary)

The notebooks created during the workshops and the notebook containing the final coding task will form your portfolio. You will have to compress all of these files into a ZIP file and upload the zip file to the DLE by the deadline.

**For referred coursework**, students will have to submit the same portfolio.

## IMPORTANT
1. While collaboration during the workshops is highly encouraged, plagiarism will not be tolerated. The University takes plagiarism very seriously and the consequences can be serious. It is extremely simple to identify code that's been simply copied and pasted, and, should I be in doubt about the ownership of any of the work presented, I reserve myself the right to call you to my office and ask you to give me a detailed explanation of your coding choices.
2. You are solely responsible for the saving, backing up and correct uploading of your coursework to the DLE.
